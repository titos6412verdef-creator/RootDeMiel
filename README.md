# RootdeMiel


試験的に作成した参考書レビューアプリ。 
Experimental Textbook Review App

目的（Purpose）: 
・指導者側の主観的な評価、生存バイアスを除くための客観的な指標が欲しい 
・教材そのものの研究ではなく教材の使い方の研究に時間を使うため 
・役割が重複している参考書を購入して時間を浪費する学生を減らすため 

To provide objective indicators that eliminate subjective evaluations and survivorship bias from instructors.
To focus research time on how textbooks are used rather than on the textbooks themselves.
To help students avoid wasting time purchasing textbooks with overlapping content.

Lotre de mier（仏語：ラッコ）が好きなのでこの名前に。 
I named it "Lotre de Miel (French for “sea otter”), because I like them.
